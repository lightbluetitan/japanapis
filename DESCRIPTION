Title: Access Japanese Data via Public APIs and Curated Datasets
Version: 0.1.0
Maintainer: Renzo Caceres Rossi <arenzocaceresrossi@gmail.com>
Description: Provides functions to access data from public RESTful APIs including 
    'Nager.Date', 'World Bank API', and 'REST Countries API', retrieving real-time or historical 
    data related to Japan, such as holidays, economic indicators, and international 
    demographic and geopolitical indicators. Additionally, the package includes one of the largest 
    curated collections of open datasets focused on Japan, covering topics such as natural disasters, 
    economic production, vehicle industry, air quality, demographics, and administrative divisions. 
    The package supports reproducible research and teaching by integrating reliable international 
    APIs and structured datasets from public, academic, and government sources.
